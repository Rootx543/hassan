Here is a quick look at each of the apps, and why we like them!\nIn case you are not familiar with Toca Boca, their apps available for iOS and Android are all about digital play. Most of them are more like toys than games, because you dont have a specific end goal",

The Toca Life apps are a great example of that.\nToca Boca provided me with download codes for Toca Life: Pets, Toca Life: Vacation, Toca Life: Hospital, and Toca Labs: Plants. Lets have a look!",
